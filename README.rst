Overview
========

MetaRho is a basic blogging app I use for my site.  I am incorporating code and
extensions to better support tagging, linked data and general semantic web
interaction.

The application itself is simple enough and sufficient for anyone looking for a
basic blogging app.  More likely there be some code examples some folks may find
useful or interesting. 

Why Should You Use MetaRho?
----------------------------

You shouldn't, go use Wordpress.  No *really*, go use Wordpress.  It's a great 
blogging application that's easy to use, has a number of plug-in and easy to 
theme.

Still here?

Alright then, it's possible you might find MetaRho useful if you really have a
desire to publish to the web and have it backed by strong structured data like
RDF, RDFa and other formats like ATOM and such.
