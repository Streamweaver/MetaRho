description: Hey Dad,

I hope you're well.  I had a bit of a disappointment this week after putting all
 that work into my Valdosta State application I found out right away the paperwo
rk didn't get there in time.  I don't have a great ability to just see it as a s
equence of paperwork issues and instead just kind of feel overwhelmed like I usu
ally do that the process is just too difficult for me to work through.

I feel like what i want to do is find anther program that will except me but I'm
 not sure how good of an approach that is either. This whole sub-text of "will y
ou accept me" can cause a lot of resentment for me since I'm doing well in my fi
eld. There just seems a dramatic disconnect that I've been so successful in this
 field but feel like there's no way for me to get accepted to study it.  I just
feel so frustrated and I know that's just because it's wrapped up in other thing
s.

I really wish I had better skills at managing this kind of thing but between you
 and Mom, it's just not something that was going to be passed onto me.  I often
feel like I really want people to understand what it's like for me and find it f
rustrating I can't communicate that.  You never finished yourself, Mom didn't, J
ohnny didn't and I can feel very much like there's just something fundamentally
wrong with me that will always make it so I'll never be able to participate in t
he better things in life.  That there's some kind of taint that will always foll
ow me. That anything I do is either doomed to be seen as either compromised beca
use I didn't have the talent ,or feel like I'm getting a hug in the sSpecial Oly
mpics because it's amazing what someone with my limitations has been able to do.
  I don't feel like I can just be a competent person.

It makes me very tired.
